\section{Introduction}
This document presents the analysis of a turbine-generator system connected via a gear pair, as detailed in the ME-340 Project for Spring 2025. The system schematic is provided in Figure \ref{fig:schematic}.

\section{System Parameters}
The following parameters are provided for the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Radius ratio of the gears: $\frac{R_4}{R_3} = 1.5$.
    \item Mass moment of inertia of Gear 3: $\inertia_3 = \SI{100}{kg\cdot m^2}$.
    \item Mass moment of inertia of Gear 4: $\inertia_4 = \SI{200}{kg\cdot m^2}$.
    \item Mass moment of inertia of the Turbine: $\inertia_1 = \SI{2000}{kg\cdot m^2}$.
    \item Mass moment of inertia of the Generator: $\inertia_2 = \SI{1000}{kg\cdot m^2}$.
    \item Torsional stiffness of Shaft 1: $\stiffness_1 = \SI{3e5}{N\cdot m/rad}$.

\section{Equations of Motion}
This section presents the derivation of the equations of motion for the system, expressed in terms of angular displacements $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$.
% Your derivations and equations go here.
% Example equation:
% \begin{equation}
%     \inertia_1 \ddot{\theta}_1 + \damping_1 \dot{\theta}_1 + \stiffness_1 (\theta_1 - \theta_3) = \torque_1(t)
% \end{equation}


\section{State-Space Model}
Here, the state-space model for the system is developed. The outputs are assumed to be the angular velocities of the turbine, generator, and Gear 3.
% Your state-space matrices (A, B, C, D) and explanations go here.


\section{Simulink Model}
This section details the development of the Simulink model for the system.
% Describe your Simulink model structure, key blocks, and how it represents the system.
% You might refer to screenshots of your Simulink model if you include them as images.


\section{Angular Velocity Response to Turbine Unit Step Input}
The angular velocities of the turbine and generator in response to a unit step input applied to the turbine ($\tau_1(t) = U(t)$) are determined using both the state-space and Simulink models.
% Present your results (plots, analysis) here.


\section{Angular Velocity Response to Generator Unit Step Input}
The angular velocities of the turbine and generator in response to a unit step input applied to the generator ($\tau_2(t) = U(t)$) are determined using both the state-space and Simulink models.
% Present your results (plots, analysis) here.


\section{Angular Velocity Response to Gear Impulse Input}
The angular velocity response of the generator to a unit impulse applied to Gear 3 ($\tau_3(t) = \delta(t)$) is determined using the state-space model.
% Present your results (plots, analysis) here.


\section{Frequency Response (Bode Plots) for Original Damping}
This section presents the frequency response (Bode plots) between the angular velocity of the generator and a sinusoidal input at Gear 3, using the state-space model. The steady-state response for a sinusoidal input at the first mode is checked using Simulink.
% Present your Bode plots and steady-state verification.


\section{Frequency Response with Reduced Damping}
The damping constants are reduced by a factor of 10. The frequency response (Bode plots) between the angular velocity of the generator and an input at Gear 3 is determined using the state-space model. The steady-state response for an input of $\tau_3(t)=\sin(30t)$ is also determined.
% Present your Bode plots and steady-state response.


\section{Frequency Response with Increased Damping}
The damping constants are increased by a factor of 10. The frequency response (Bode plots) between the angular velocity of the generator and an input at Gear 3 is determined using the state-space model. The steady-state response for an input of $\tau_3(t)=\sin(30t)$ is also determined.

\section{Vibratory Modes}
A sketch of the first two vibratory modes of the system is provided.
